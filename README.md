# urg_recording_and_display_2
For recording, displaying, and saving real-time data from the Hokuyo URG-04lX-UG01 LIDAR.

Used in conjunction with [Dan Moore's ofxURG sender application](https://github.com/danthemellowman/ofxUrg).

Apps:
- urg_record is used to record an environment. It can also render real-time recordings.
- urg_display is used to display these recordings in various drawing modes.

Examples of projects that can be made with these apps include those documented [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Project%203/Project%203.md) and [here](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/students/benjamin/Final%20Project/Final%20Project.md).

Developed in Golan Levin's class Experimental Capture, Carnegie Mellon University Fall 2015
